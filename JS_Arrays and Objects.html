    <h2>Arrays and Objects :-</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The object class represents one of JavaScript’s data types.</li>
        <li>It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.</li>
        <li>Objects can be created using the Object() constructor.</li>
        <li>we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference.</li>
        <li>To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Examples of primitive data types :-</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>let myVar = 34;</li>
            <li>let myVar2 = "string";</li>
            <li>let myVar3 = true;</li>
            <li>let myVar4 = null;</li>
            <li>let myVar5 = undefined;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note :- Apart from primitive data types, all the other are objects.</p>
        <h3>Objects :-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The object class represents one of JavaScript’s data types.</li>
            <li>Objects can be created using object() constructor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Arrays :-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a special kind of object known as 'arrays'</li>
            <li>The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects</li>
            <li>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.</li>
            <li>We can also create arrays with the help of a 'new' keyword.</li>
            <li>arrays created using 'new' keyword should have '( )' as the constructor instead of '[ ]', otherwise it throws an error.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
